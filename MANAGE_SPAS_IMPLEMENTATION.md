# ManageSpas Implementation Guide

## Overview
The ManageSpas feature has been successfully implemented with enhanced functionality as requested. This system provides comprehensive spa management with categorized views and dynamic data handling.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Three Main Categories**
- **Approved Spas**: Shows all approved spas with sub-categorization
- **Rejected Spas**: Shows all rejected spa registrations
- **Pending Spas**: Shows spas awaiting admin approval

### 2. **Approved Spas Sub-Categories**
- **Verified**: Paid annual fee before deadline ✅
- **Unverified**: Unpaid annual fee before deadline ⚠️
- **Blacklisted**: Admin-added to blacklist ❌

### 3. **Dynamic Data Display**
All data is fetched dynamically from the `lsa_spa_management.spas` table with proper status filtering:

| Column | Field Mapping | Description |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Spa Details | `name`, `owner_fname`, `owner_lname`, `owner_email` | Full spa and owner info |
| Reference | `spa_br_number`, `province` | Business registration number |
| Status | Calculated based on `status`, `payment_status`, `blacklist_reason` | Dynamic status badges |
| Payment | `payment_status` | Paid/Unpaid status |
| Registration Date | `created_at` | Formatted date |
| Actions | Dynamic based on status | Context-sensitive buttons |

### 4. **Smart Search Functionality**
Search works across:
- Spa name (`name`)
- Reference number (`spa_br_number`)  
- Owner name (`owner_fname` + `owner_lname`)
- Owner email (`owner_email`)

### 5. **Action System**

#### For **Pending Spas**:
- 👁️ **View**: Shows complete spa details with all documents
- ✅ **Approve**: Changes status to 'approved' with confirmation
- ❌ **Reject**: Changes status to 'rejected' with reason input

#### For **Approved Spas** (Verified/Unverified):
- 👁️ **View**: Shows complete spa details
- 🚫 **Blacklist**: Adds to blacklist with reason (user-friendly)

#### For **Rejected Spas**:
- 👁️ **View**: Shows complete spa details and rejection reason

#### For **Blacklisted Spas**:
- 👁️ **View**: Shows details and blacklist reason

### 6. **Detailed View Modal**
The view action opens a comprehensive modal showing:
- **Basic Information**: Name, BR number, contact details
- **Owner Information**: Full owner details including NIC
- **Address Information**: Complete address with province
- **Registration Information**: Dates, payment status, reasons
- **Documents Section**: All uploaded documents with download links
- **Action Buttons**: Context-sensitive approve/reject/blacklist buttons

## Database Schema Mapping

### Required Database Columns
```sql
-- Core identification
id, name, spa_br_number

-- Owner information  
owner_fname, owner_lname, owner_email, owner_nic
owner_tel, owner_cell

-- Address
address_line1, address_line2, province, postal_code

-- Status management
status ('pending', 'verified', 'rejected')
payment_status ('pending', 'paid', 'overdue')
blacklist_reason (TEXT, NULL for non-blacklisted)
blacklisted_at (TIMESTAMP)

-- Documents
nic_front_path, nic_back_path, br_attachment_path
tax_registration_path, other_doc_path
facility_photos (JSON), professional_certifications (JSON)

-- Timestamps
created_at, updated_at
```

## API Endpoints

### GET `/api/lsa/spas`
- Fetches all spas with complete information
- No authentication required for now
- Returns paginated results with status information

### PATCH `/api/lsa/spas/:id/approve`
- Approves a pending spa
- Changes status from 'pending' to 'approved'
- Logs activity and sends notifications

### PATCH `/api/lsa/spas/:id/reject`
- Rejects a pending spa  
- Requires rejection reason in request body
- Changes status to 'rejected'

### PATCH `/api/lsa/spas/:id/blacklist`
- Blacklists an approved spa
- Requires blacklist reason in request body
- Sets blacklist_reason and blacklisted_at fields

## UI Design Principles

### Color Scheme
- **Primary**: `#001F3F` (Navy Blue) - Main branding color
- **Success**: Green tones - For verified/approved status
- **Warning**: Orange tones - For unverified status  
- **Danger**: Red tones - For rejected/blacklisted status
- **Info**: Blue tones - For pending status

### User Experience
- **Clean Design**: Maintains existing UI patterns
- **Responsive**: Works on all screen sizes

- **Accessible**: Clear labels and color coding
- **User-Friendly**: Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
